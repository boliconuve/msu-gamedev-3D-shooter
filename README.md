# Eternal Invasion - 3D shooter
I have created a 3D shooter game made in Unity 3D. 

My main goal with this project is to learn and apply art, design and programming concepts. I made this approach to grow my knowledge within my chosen discipline, while art, design and code come together to make a game. To become a better game developer.

# The concepts I have learned:
  - Creating 3D games in Unity.
  - Using Unity Terrain to create environments.
  - To create more elaborate user interfaces (UI).
  - Better understand the asset pipeline.
  - Configuration of the 3D assets used.
  - Level design in 3D space.

# Other concepts I have also learned:
  - Creating a complex C# script from scratch, the Player Controller script.
  - Getting familiar with Visual Studio Code.
  - Using NavMesh to create Enemy movement.
  - Introduction to a more complex game system.
  - Continuing to familiarise myself with the Unity editor.
  - Using Unity best practices.
  - Using Unity's best tips and techniques.
